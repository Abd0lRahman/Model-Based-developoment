# This lab has taught me the basic Simulink blocks,
# such as
	the Product Block: Used to multiply two signals together.
	Gain Block: Used to amplify or attenuate a signal.
	Sum Block: Used to add or subtract two signals.
	Constant Block: Used to generate a constant signal.
	Display Block: Used to display signal in a specific line

# And some other concepts,
# such as
	how to use these blocks and build a simple simulation model. 
	Understanding these fundamental blocks is crucial for more complex simulations and control system designs.
	Usage of different things in Simulink like area, subsystem, etc...
